## Project Description
OpenCourt solves the problem of not being able to easily find open play locations for sports like pickleball, basketball, tennis, volleyball, and more.

### Current Features
- Fully Dockerized Stack
    - The entire application (frontend, backend, and database) is containerized with Docker Compose for portability and ease of setup
- Automated Setup Scripts
    - Includes scripts for prepping a new VM and for setting up the application locally or on a VM
- Nginx Reverse Proxy
    - A web container runs Nginx to serve the static React build and act as a reverse proxy for the backend, eliminating CORS issues.
- MySQL database
    - Tables: users, locations, games, and games_users
    - Configured for remote Workbench access on port 3307
    - Runs in its own Docker container
    - Automatically creates tables and seeds data on first launch
- MVC-style API
    - Runs in a Node.js container using PM2 for process management.
    - Basic CRUD functionality (Create/Read) for users, locations, and games.
- React + Vite frontend application 
    - Connects to the proxied /api/ endpoints.
    - Components for Games, Locations, and Users.
    - Simple, responsive UI

## The Plan
- Extend CRUD functionality
    - Update: Change locations, times, players, size of party
    - Delete: Remove events, players
- User profiles, which could include sports they play, rating/level of skill, profile pictures
- Payment links, for court/rental fees, tournament entry fees

### Data Model Planning
**Core Entities**: Events, Users, Location

**Key Relationships**: Users can host Events, Events can have multiples Users, Events have one location, Locations can host multiple events

**CRUD Operations**:
1. Users can create events
2. Users can join events
3. Users can view events and participants
4. Hosts can remove users
5. Hosts can update event details
6. Users can leave events
7. Hosts can delete events

### User Experience

**User Flows**:
A user can either **host** or **participate** in an event. 
- **Hosts**
    - determine the event size, sport, location, and time.
    - can remove players or delete events
- **Participants**
    - can browse and join events.
    - can leave an event anytime.

## Known Issues

There is currently an issue where when an event, location, or user is added to the database, it is not immediately reflected on the website. The user has to refresh the page for the newest addition to display. This is not a Docker Issue and so was not addressed during this Sprint.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (for Local Development): You must have Docker Desktop installed and running on your local machine to use [setup-local.sh](setup-local.sh)

## VM Setup
1. Open a terminal on your local machine
2. Log into your VM using your IP Address and Password:
    
    ```bash
    ssh root@{vm-ip-address}
    ```
3. Run the following command to update your VM and install Git:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y && sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt upgrade -yq
    ```
4. Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kellerflint/OpenCourt.git
    ```

5. CD into the project and make the scripts executable:

    ```bash
    CD OpenCourt/
    chmod +x prepare-vm.sh setup.sh
    ```

6. Run the VM Setup Script:
    - This will install Docker, Compose, Curl, and set the firewall

    ```bash
    sudo ./prepare-vm.sh
    ```

### IMPORTANT: Log out and back in - This is required for your user to be added to the docker group

7. Run the Application Setup Script:
    - This will build your containers, handle .env and nginx.conf configuration, and start your application

    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```

8. Follow Prompts: The script will ask you to enter what passwords you want to use for database access

9. Access Your Application:
    - Website: http://your-vm-ip
    - MySQL Workbench:
        - Host: your-vm-ip
        - Port: 3307
        - Username: app_user
        - Password: The app_user password you chose during setup

## Updating the Application on the VM

When you push new code to your repo, run the [update.sh](update.sh) script to deploy them.

1. SSH into your VM and CD to OpenCourt/
2. Activate and run the script

    ```bash
    chmod +x update.sh
    ./update.sh
    ```

This will pull the latest code and rebuild only the necessary containers. Your database data will be preserved

### IMPORTANT - This script does NOT apply database schema changes. To apply changes to tables, you must destroy the database volume and then run docker-compose up -d --build

- Command to destroy database volume

    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    ```

## Local Setup
1. Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kellerflint/OpenCourt.git
    ```
2. Ensure Docker Desktop is running

3. Make script executable and run it:
    - This will build your containers, handle .env and nginx.conf configuration, and start your application

    ```bash
    chmod +x setup-local.sh
    ./setup-local.sh
    ```

4. Follow Prompts: The script will ask you to enter what passwords you want to use for database access

9. Access Your Application:
    - Website: http://localhost
    - MySQL Workbench:
        - Host: localhost
        - Port: 3307
        - Username: app_user
        - Password: The app_user password you set during setup

### Updating Locally

From the root directory, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will rebuild the images for the code you changed and restart the containers. Your MySQL database data will be preserved.

If you need to apply changes to the database and reset your data, your must destroy the database volume:

```bash
# This stops and removes containers AND destroys the database volume
docker-compose down -v

# This rebuilds all images and starts fresh containers
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Docker Setup

### Part 0: Modifying your .env files | <code style="color : red">*IMPORTANT!*</code>
When using Docker inside of the VM, you will need to modify your `.env` files to make sure the `docker-compose.yml` file works inside of the project. 

***Steps:***

1. The .env file that you created earlier, you'll need to access that and add another parameter.
    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```
2. Inside of the .env file you're going to need to add/edit.
    ```env
    DB_HOST=database
    DB_ROOT_PW=example
    ```
    ##### <code style="color : Yellow">*!!! Make sure that DB_HOST is set to **database**. This is required for the Docker network to work properly and securely.*</code>
3. Save you credentials out of nano, by doing `CTRL + O`, and then hit `ENTER`.
4. Next, you'll need to go into the frontend folder and modify that .env file as well.
    ```bash
    cd src/frontend/opencourt
    nano .env
    ```
5. Inside of this .env file, you'll need to verify the `VITE_SERVER_HOST` and `VITE_SERVER_PORT` variables are set to the variables below.
    ```env
    VITE_SERVER_HOST = "localhost"  
    VITE_SERVER_PORT = "3000"
    ```
6. Save you credentials out of nano, by doing `CTRL + O`, and then hit `ENTER`.
7. Return back to the root directory by doing:
    ```bash
        cd ../../../../
    ```

### Part 1: Installing Docker onto the VM *(Virtual Machine)*
Inside the root directory run this command to install Docker with the necessary packages and dependencies on your VM, along with starting the docker containers.
```bash
    bash project_INIT.sh    # Runs another shell script - get_docker.sh
```

<br>
<br>

---
### Running Docker and Stopping Docker

Now you should be able to run the `docker-compose.yml` file from the root directory of the project and stop it. 

To Start the Docker Containers, run:
```bash
    docker-compose up -d    #This is here in case you need to start the docker containers back up. 
```

To Stop the Docker Containers, run:
```bash
    docker-compose down     #To remove the containers
```
or

```bash
    docker-compose stop     #To NOT remove the containers
```

<br>

**To visit the Frontend page, navigate to `http://{vm-ip-address}:5174`**
<br>
<br>

## How to use Adminer
1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://{vm-ip-address}:8081`
2. Fill in the login credentials as follows:
   - System: MySQL
   - Server: database
   - Username: {your-username}
   - Password: {your-password}
   - Database: opencourt
3. Click "Login" to access the database management interface.

### Restarting Docker

If your application freezes (either on the VM or locally) and there have been no code changes, run the following command to restart Docker:

```bash
docker-compose restart
```

## Testing
OpenCourt includes **unit tests** for both the front and backend, **integration tests** and **end to end tests**.

### Running all Unit & Integration Tests
1. Make sure you followed the steps in [Local Setup](#local-setup) to ensure you have your environment properly set up.
2. Make script executable and run it:
    - This will automatically run all tests and exit any necessary terminals making it fast and easy to quickly run a test.

    ```bash
    chmod +x run-tests.sh
    ./run-tests.sh
    ```

### Running all End to End Tests
A script has been written to help quickly set up a dockerized test environment perfect for end to end testing.

1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running
2. Make script executable and run it:
    - This will automatically run and build all docker containers, handle any database configuration and launch the cypress terminal for you to use.

    ```bash
    chmod +x ./test-scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh
    ./test-scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh
    ```

### Have you already built the test environment and want to just run the end to end tests?
1. Make sure you are in the proper directory for the front-end.
2. Check that the opencourt_test docker container is running.
3. Run the following command in your terminal to run **just** the cypress tests.
```bash
    npm run cypress
```

#### Need to test changes you've made in the code?
```bash
docker-compose -p opencourt_test -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
```

#### Want to clear the test database to prevent dirty data?
```bash
docker-compose -p opencourt_test down
```

#### Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues you may encounter when running tests:
1. Docker not running
   - Docker **must** be installed and running on your machine for any of these tests to work.
2. template.env or template.nginx.conf not found
   - Make sure these template files exist in the root directory of your project. The E2E and local-setup script depends on it.
